## My process

I started with writing the html I decided to use a flexbox column container. Inside the flexbox container I put in 3 items. The qr-container-background which serves as the white background of the container. The qr-container-photo, which serves as the qr code image provided. Finally, the h2 and the p which I used the styling given to me by the project. Inside my CSS I set up my :root values and gave the var colors I would be using. Then I coded all of the CSS changing sizing and padding. One thing I feel I could have done better on is centering images. Instead of doing this with CSS I centered the qr code with <center> in the html.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I actually learned how to add more options in terms of making a flexbox container, this allowed me to keep everything pretty much responsive without having to mess around too much with media queries. Instead of giving my default container a background color I nested a container inside of my main container, this made it much easier to style everything and to make sure everything was centered correctly!

### Continued development

In future projects I want to continue to get better at making things responsive. Also, I want to be able to setup my CSS pages more professionally. Finally, I want to improve on centering things better and just working on the mobile side of things to make my layouts span clean across all devices.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) - This helped me remember how to use CSS Variables because I kind of forgot how to write them out!
- [Example resource 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/responsive-web-design-how-to-make-a-website-look-good-on-phones-and-tablets/) - I didn't end up needing to use any media queries with this project but I did an overview of this before I got started and it had some good information. It also gave me the idea of just making the qr code with flexbox which I did not know was an option before I started the project!
